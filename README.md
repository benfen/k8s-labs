# k8s-labs
Simple Kubernetes labs

The aim of this repo is to provide a serious of labs that can be done using Kubernetes to help expand and develop an understanding of how Kubernetes operates.
Examples presented here are kept as concise and brief as possible.
All of the labs rely on the same suite of tools, so make sure to start with the [setup](001-setup/README.md) lab.
If a lab requires anything extra, it will be sure to call this out in the `prerequisites` header at the top.
